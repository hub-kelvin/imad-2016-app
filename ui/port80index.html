But he got a free iPhone out of it

(KIEV, Ukraine) — A Ukrainian man has officially changed his name to iPhone 7 after an electronics store offered the latest Apple product to the first five people who do that.

The 20-year old iPhone Sim (Seven) got the coveted prize Friday. He said he might change it back to his original name, Olexander Turin, when he has children.

The price of phone starts at US $850 in Ukraine, while the name changes costs the equivalent of $2.

Sim’s friends and family were shocked at first but eventually supported the idea.

His sister, Tetyana Panina, said “it was difficult to accept that and hard to believe it’s true.” She added: “Each person in this world is looking for a way to express himself. Why not to do that in this way?”
